# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A bike sharing startup is trying to solidify a business proposal for use in Des Moines, Iowa.  We have brought together information based on CitiBike from Manhatten, a burough of New York city, to help show trends and opportunities.

## Resources
- Data Source: 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv
- Software: Python 3.10.1, Visual Studio Code 1.63.2, Pandas 1.2.4
- See link below for Tableau Public presentation to see more in depth of the graphic details

## Results

- **Breakdown Viz**

This Viz shows breakdowns by gender and customers/subscribers in separate pie charts and a heat map for all genders and customer/subscribers with emphasis on days of use.

We can see with *User Trips by Gender by Weekday* that Male subscribers are by far the highest users of the program, and Thursday and Friday have the highest activity.  The *Gender Breakdown* pie chart shows men make up the most users of the program and the *Customers* shows the overwhelming majority of users are subscribers, regardless of gender. 

- **Trips**

Both graphs utilize a heatmap to highlight the time of the trips during the weekdays. *Trips by Weekday per Hour* is an overall picture showing standard morning and evening commutting hours have the highest activities.  This trend also holds true for *Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)* heatmap as well, but also reinforcing the huge upward trend of Male users.

- **Checkout Times**

These graphs are depicting the average lenght of each trip per number of bikes utilized.  *Checkout Time for Users* illustrates rough 150,000 bikes being used for around 45 minute trips.  The *Checkout Time by Genders* shows how the checkout times are dominated by males, with over 100,000 bikes, versus females and unknown of less than 40,000.  The males tend to ride longer, over 40 minutes, while females and unknown are trending closer to 10 minutes less at 30 minutes.

- **Placement**

This depiction of Manhatten illustrates the density of usage from start of the trip to the ending.  There is some decent spread amongst everything south of Central Park, but noticing entertainment, business, and riverfront tend to have higher density, thus more usage.  Since most people are subscribers and not just customers, these individuals appear to be using it more for commuting from home to office based on the density.

## Summary
Based on the graphs and the data shown, it appears the majority of people in the Manhatten sector are: Using CitiBikes for commuting based of time of weekday usage; CitiBikes are primarily used by male subscribers, on an average of 40 minutes of use; and subscribtions drive more usage than generic customers.

To gain further insight with the data provided by CitiBikes, it would be prudent to look also at usage by age as well.  Depending on certain areas of Manhatten, we could have a certain pockets of the ideal age of bikers which could help focus placement of any future bike program.

Another visualization to use is to isolate outliers.  We could have several very high users, making many more trips than the standard deviation, and contrarily, have some, primarily subscribers, using it very little or going a short distance.
